Description: Functions to calculate estimates of intrinsic and extrinsic noise from the two-reporter single-cell experiment, as in Elowitz, M. B., A. J. Levine, E. D. Siggia, and P. S. Swain (2002) Stochastic gene expression in a single cell. Science, 297, 1183-1186.  Functions implement multiple estimators developed for unbiasedness or min Mean Squared Error (MSE) in Fu, A. Q. and Pachter, L. (2016). Estimating intrinsic and extrinsic noise from single-cell gene expression measurements. Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology, 15(6), 447-471.
